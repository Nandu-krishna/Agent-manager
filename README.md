# 🧑‍💼 Agent Manager – MERN Stack Application

A full-stack application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack that allows admin users to log in, manage agents, and upload & distribute CSV data equally among agents.

---

## 🧠 Project Objective

To implement a role-based management system with the following core features:

- Admin user login with authentication
- Agent creation and management
- CSV file upload with validation
- Automatic and equal distribution of list entries among agents
- View distributed data per agent

---

## ✨ Features

### ✅ User Login (Admin)
- Secure login using JWT-based authentication
- Email and password-based validation
- Redirects to dashboard on successful login
- Displays relevant error messages on failure

### 🧾 Agent Management
- Admin can add new agents with:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Mobile number (with country code)
  - Password
- Agent data is securely stored in MongoDB

### 📤 CSV Upload and List Distribution
- Upload files in `.csv`, `.xlsx`, or `.xls` formats
- Validates the uploaded file structure:
  - `FirstName` – Text
  - `Phone` – Number
  - `Notes` – Text
- Distributes data equally among 5 agents
- Handles non-divisible entries gracefully (extra items are assigned sequentially)
- Displays distributed lists for each agent
